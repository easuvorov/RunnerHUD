Complex DataField for Garmin Forerunner 23x and 630

Foreword: although being a big step forward in comparison to previous generation "hard-coded" data layouts, Garmin SDK currently lacks tools and means to provide easy to use development framework. Nevertheless there is a possibility to develop applications and I decided to use this opportunity. Why such big words? Because out of almost 50 manhours spent on this project, I spent only about quarter of time actually developing, while other three quarters were used to optimize and align code. There is a predefined memory limit of 16kb for Garmin IQ DataField, but practice shows that even if your application memory usage as shown in SDK device Simulator is about 14kb or more field tends to show performance degradation (slow redraw) and stability issues (crashes). Even worse is the situation, that the virtual machine on watch seems to be your average interpreter without too much optimizations in byte-code, this means that even if you add 3-4 lines of code it may add another 200 bytes in memory and break your overall performance. This leads to heavy code alignment, that makes sources almost unreadable: e.g. conversion of easy to read multiple if's into complex conditional assignments, declaration of less functions, since any declaration use memory, even long comprehensive variable names may hinder your optimization efforts... What you see in this project is a result of heavy optimizations and many hours spent in trial and error attempts to improve memory usage and performance, where almost every line of code undergone multiple refactors. It wasn't easy or very interesting, but in the end it works very well indeed.

Hope this will help someone to create something even better with Garmin SDK.
Best regards and good luck 8)
